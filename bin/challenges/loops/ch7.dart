/*
  While loops.

  It doesn't feel right does it? Why should the user have to re-run the program
  because he was a bad user?

  We should simply ask him again and again, until he becomes a good user!
  How can we do that? Well, take a look at this example

  EXAMPLE

    bool condition = true;
    while (condition) {
       String userString = stdin.readLineSync();
       condition = userString != 'stop';
    }

  What's happening in the example?
    1. The boolean condition is true, so when we reach the while condition,
       it's true so the loop starts.
    2. Then we ask for a input from the terminal
    3. We check if the input is stop, and put said logical check into the
       'condition' variable. If the text is not "stop" then condition=true.
    4. Then we reach the top of the loop again, if the condition is true, we
       simply keep going inside the loop, until condition finally becomes
       false.

  Copy your code from ch6 and try to wrap a while loop around it!

import 'dart:io';

void main() {


  bool condition = true;

  while(condition){
    print('input the right number; ');
    int userNumber = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync());
    condition = userNumber != 100;
  }


  print('im finally free from the loop!');

}
